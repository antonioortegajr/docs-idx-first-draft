## Getting Started Questions
- #### “Can I get MLS data from your API?”
Our API does not currently return MLS data or MLS property listing data. The only exception is listings belonging to the agents on an IDX Broker account. More on this…
- #### “What data can I get?”
Lead data, agent info, featured listings, info on the MLS, widget source URLs, saved links, search fields and values, and a lot more.
- #### “How much does it cost?”
The IDX Broker API is available to anyone with a valid API key at no extra charge. Your key can be found in your IDX Broker account.
- ##### “Do you have sample code?”
Yes! You can find official examples here.
We also offer lessons on API consumption here. Unofficial examples can be found on this repo.
