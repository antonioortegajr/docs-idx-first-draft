IDX Broker refers to CNAME records as custom subdomians. By default your IDX Pages are hosted on a subdomain of idxbroker.com. For example, if your website address is: http://greatpropertyforsale.com, your standard IDX links would have an address starting with: http://greatpropertyforsale.idxbroker.com/ (ie: http://subdomain.primarydomain.com/)

We can point the IDX pages to your domain instead of idxbroker.com. Instead of using the standard idxbroker.com subdomain, you can implement a custom domain of your choosing. This changes your links to this: http://yourchoice.greatpropertyforsale.com/

A custom domain accomplishes the following:

Ensures that pages, which are indexed by Google and other search engines, are associated with your primary website (instead of ours). The domain control tool allows your main domain name to represent your business, appear in search engine results, and be used for analytics and marketing.

Eliminates the -IDX Broker appendage to your page titles on Google.

Customize to anything you would like, popular choices are search.yourdomain.com, realestate.yourdomain.com, atlanta-homes.yourdomain.com, or something similar.

NOTE: When choosing a CNAME record, a short name is typically better and please do NOT use MLS (ie: http://mls.primarydomain.com/) as many MLS board(s) do not allow this.
